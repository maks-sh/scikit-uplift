The MineThatData E-Mail Analytics And Data Mining Challenge
It is time to find a few smart individuals in the world of e-mail analytics and data mining! And honestly, what follows is a dataset that you can manipulate using Excel pivot tables, so you don't have to be a data mining wizard, just be clever!

[Here is a link to the MineThatData E-Mail Analytics And Data Mining Challenge dataset:]( http://www.minethatdata.com/Kevin_Hillstrom_MineThatData_E-MailAnalytics_DataMiningChallenge_2008.03.20.csv) The dataset is in .csv format, and is about the size of a typical mp3 file. I recommend saving the file to disk, then open the file (read only' in the software tool of your choice.

This dataset contains 64,000 customers who last purchased within twelve months. The customers were involved in an e-mail test.
* 1/3 were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Mens merchandise.
* 1/3 were randomly chosen to receive an e-mail campaign featuring Womens merchandise.
* 1/3 were randomly chosen to not receive an e-mail campaign.

During a period of two weeks following the e-mail campaign, results were tracked. Your job is to tell the world if the Mens or Womens e-mail campaign was successful.

Historical customer attributes at your disposal include:

* Recency: Months since last purchase.
* History_Segment: Categorization of dollars spent in the past year.
* History: Actual dollar value spent in the past year.
* Mens: 1/0 indicator, 1 = customer purchased Mens merchandise in the past year.
* Womens: 1/0 indicator, 1 = customer purchased Womens merchandise in the past year.
* Zip_Code: Classifies zip code as Urban, Suburban, or Rural.
* Newbie: 1/0 indicator, 1 = New customer in the past twelve months.
* Channel: Describes the channels the customer purchased from in the past year.

Another variable describes the e-mail campaign the customer received:
* Segment
* Mens E-Mail
* Womens E-Mail
* No E-Mail

Finally, we have a series of variables describing activity in the two weeks following delivery of the e-mail campaign:
* Visit: 1/0 indicator, 1 = Customer visited website in the following two weeks.
* Conversion: 1/0 indicator, 1 = Customer purchased merchandise in the following two weeks.
