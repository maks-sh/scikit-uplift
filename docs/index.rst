scikit-uplift
**************

**scikit-uplift (sklift)** is a Python module for basic approaches of uplift modeling built on top of scikit-learn.

Uplift prediction aims to estimate the causal impact of a treatment at the individual level.

More about uplift modelling problem read `in russian on habr.com`_.

Features
#########

* Comfortable and intuitive style of modelling like scikit-learn;

* Applying any estimator adheres to scikit-learn conventions;

* Almost all implemented approaches solve both the problem of classification and regression;

* A lot of metrics (Such as *Area Under Uplift Curve* or *Area Under Qini Curve*) are implemented to evaluate your uplift model.


**The package currently supports the following methods:**

1. Solo Model (aka Treatment Dummy) approach
2. Class Transformation (aka Class Variable Transformation or Revert Label) approach
3. Two Models (aka naïve approach, or difference score method, or double classifier approach) approach, including Dependent Data Representation

**And the following metrics:**

1. Uplift@k
2. Area Under Uplift Curve
3. Area Under Qini Curve
